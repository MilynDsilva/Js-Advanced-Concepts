Difference between var and let keywords
    var has been in js since begining
    it has function scope
    variable defined with var keyword will die at the end of the function
    variables defined with var keyword get hoisted at the top of the function


    let was introduced in es2015
    it has a blockscope
    variable defined with let keyword will die at the end of the block
    variabled defined with let dont get hoisted

Ex:
let output = function() {

if (true) {
    var v = 2;  //value of v exisit outside the block
    let l = 1;  //value of l wont exist outside the block
    //console. log(v);  //value exists here
    //console. log(1);  //value exists here
}

console.log(v); // no error
console.log(l); //error 
}
output();
